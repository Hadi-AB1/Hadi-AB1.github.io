                                                           Professional self-assessment:

Following my classes across the course of study and creating this ePortfolio have allowed me to demonstrate my abilities as well as my knowledge of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. I've also received valuable knowledge and experience in privacy, teamwork, and dealing with stakeholders. In this ePortfolio, I've been prepared to demonstrate my programming competence in C++, Java, and SQL.

During my time participating in the CS-250 course at SNHU, I've been able to acquire experience and a firm grasp of the necessity of teamwork and interacting with stakeholders. Throughout that course, I was allowed to play the roles of different people in an agile team of developers and collaborate with other people who were playing the same roles. The positions involved included scrum master, product manager, and developer. The time worked in that course and everything that I acquired taught me the value of the various roles of a team of developers and how important it is to collaborate, which includes communication with the stakeholders of the project, with the goal to meet convey and consumer deadlines and specifications. Overall, every single one of the classes I took at SNHU that had a direct connection to computer science emphasized the significance of software design and engineering and provided me with a better grasp of it.

The CS-260 class at SNHU equipped me with an excellent grasp of information structures and algorithms. I learned about linked lists and algorithms for searching, hash tables and hashing algorithms, vector organizing, hash tables, and binary search trees, amongst other programming concepts and approaches. Learning and applying these various data structures and algorithms was critical for comprehending the significance of data management in the creation of software and how algorithms may save precious resources, and time.

The database course enhanced my knowledge of databases and security. This course particularly taught me how to interact with databases in MongoDB and secure them such that only those individuals with passwords and tokens for authentication could access and edit them. Knowing how to interact with and modify a database is a valuable ability to possess, but when there is no protection and anyone who has access to the information can edit it, this may be a major issue. Security is critical to the preservation of knowledge in databases and all additional elements of software development, so it must be its main emphasis with any significant undertaking beforehand it is released to the general population or anyone who shouldn't have accessibility to control data or source code in order to safeguard the team and the developers' proprietary information.
                                                        
   For this ePortfolio, I chose three separate artifacts, one for every group that was included. Of obviously, I might have selected a single artifact to demonstrate improvements with for every category, but I experienced that employing three distinct ones would be an effective way to divide it up and demonstrate my abilities and knowledge of each of the three areas of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. I had a good time completing my portfolio and I'm planning in the future to keep enhancing the artifacts into more complex software.   

                                                                 The three artifacts

A C++ software that determines a student's median rating and letter grade is an initial artifact. This is one of the programs I made when I originally started learning C++ as a programming language. It was founded based on the C++ course on the Codecademy site that I took a couple of years ago.I chose this item since I thought it would make an excellent representation of my multilingualism and comprehension. One of the possibilities listed in the rubric was to think about translating an assignment into another programming language, which is exactly what I did with mine. The artifact has undergone improvements so that it may now be used in a broader Java project instead of only C++, though I do not believe that it has been made better technically.

I also think that it proves that I can use that skill in a large project, especially when working in my future job when asked to change software to another programming language, that kind of skill is important in the workforce. Regarding the improvement of the artifact, I believe transferring the script from C++ into Java and running it without errors would be a great example of understanding multiple programming languages as mentioned in the rubric of our course. I believe I have met the course objectives that I was planning to meet with the enhancement in module one. I have met some of the course outcomes for this enhancement as such; In the discipline of computer science, use techniques for creating cooperative settings that allow a variety of audiences to assist in company decision-making. Creating, architecting, and presenting written, verbal, and visual communications of an expert caliber that are technically sound, logical, and well-tailored to different audiences and situations. Show that you can apply reputable and cutting-edge methods, abilities, and resources in computing practices to build computer solutions that provide value and meet specific industry objectives.

I discovered that, at least superficially, the two languages are fairly comparable during the process of translating this C++ application into Java, and that knowing the fundamentals of both of them was quite helpful. The most difficult thing for me to do was to pick up where I left off with C++ and start coding in Java again. It took a little longer than it would have taken if I had been studying Java code because it had been a while since I performed any of it. It was a good experience as I have never attempted to transfer software from one programming language to another, even though the project is relatively small, it’s a good start to transferring a bigger project from one programming language to another. 

The big enhancement that I did for this artifact besides changing the script from C++ to Java. The advantages of the improvement I made are listed below. Putting in place a user-friendly GUI, also a lovely format for the output. Incorporating sophisticated query features like GPA ranges and surname wildcards. giving the individual the ability to add and remove courses. Rely just on JRE and no additional external environments or plugins. Occasionally, the UGMS uses checkboxes or messaging windows to trigger warnings.

            The Zoo Monitor System Program is the artifact that was chosen for the algorithms and data structure category. The objective of this program is to create a system for verification that controls permissions and verification for admins and zookeeper clients. As a component of the computer science seminar IT-145, the software application was conceptualized, created, and developed. The software is created in the programming language known as Java and runs on a machine with a terminal as an independent program. This artifact was chosen because it required comprehension of an application algorithm made up of two primary systems, an authentication & authorization system, and components for a system of surveillance that were enhanced. The users ought to only see information relevant to their role after they log into the application in question. The artifact is made up of architectural elements for user credential-based authentication and authorization into the monitor system as well as responsibility for the user's interactions with various module screens and actions depending on their position inside the monitor network.
 
The artifact entails the development of procedures for input data validation as well as default denial-aware architecture and design. This ability instills in us an attitude of security that foresees hostile vulnerabilities in software structures and designs to reveal potential weaknesses, reduce deficiencies in design, and guarantee privacy as well as enhanced information safety and resource protection. Several classes and methods are divided within the source code according to their functions and actions. We use arguments and variables in scope to demonstrate the technical implications of the connection and functioning between the various classes and methods. scanning external files into a string array variable-based flexible data structure to assess the circumstances surrounding user inputs, scanning data files line-by-line to assess conditions, and scanning information files to show their contents on the screen. The basic linear structure of data used by all of the application's classes' methods is the string array. By controlling the compromises involved in design decisions, this method enhances the development and assessment of computing solutions that use computational concepts, computer science techniques, and standards relevant to its resolution to tackle a specific issue. 

Through importing from outside animal or habitat files, individuals can now list possible creatures or habitats, keep track of the daily activities of the animals under supervision, and monitor the living conditions of the animals. We demonstrate our prowess in software development, user needs analysis and interpretation, and programmatic implementation of tasks inside a structured framework. The capacity to convert a software situation into pseudocode as a single piece of program code comes from knowing the algorithms needed for it. We are able to identify the structured arrangement of a sequence of codes that may be divided into four classes and one main class. A menu display class that is repeated in each of the three main system modules makes up a single of the four classes. In order to present a header and banner, empty the shell screen, and utilize two independent classes—one for Basic colors and another for wrap lines—we incorporate GUI operations into the application's foundation. These acts illustrate our capacity to apply sound and creative technology approaches, skills, and resources to develop sustainable technology solutions that add value and achieve particular industry objectives. They also accord with the fundamentals of customer-centered design.

The source code is consistently formatted correctly, has a clear organization, and includes line breaks. According to best practices and their application in computer programming, we make use of the correct syntax and norms. The programmable data structures that are created allow for the effective use of the recorded value of variables in other class methods. Since they describe operations being carried out on a certain thing, names for methods are verbs. Dividing into methods and classes, as well as how to categorize each one and its placement when integrated into the program, results in substantial problems. We modified the software to handle problems as a result of this classification approach by figuring out if it operates through the operating system's terminal shell or via the NetBeans outputting line. In order to get our application coding to the desired point, we experimented with several code blocks to demonstrate a straightforward GUI with an attractive display. I think that’s one of the difficulties that I have to deal with while working on the enhancements for this artifact.

  I've decided to improve a MySQL database from the DAD-220 class as the artifact. Content from a database had to be added, updated, deleted, and pulled for this undertaking. SQL was used for that, and the use of the command line was needed to carry out the necessary operations. I decided to improve this project by utilizing Python to provide a graphical user interface and SQLite to get the information. I had little to no understanding of how Python and SQLite interacted when I began this project, so it was enjoyable and gratifying. It wasn't easy at first, as I had to spend a lot of time researching how to utilize SQLite in Python, but eventually, I got the hang of it and had the ability to add practically every function I wanted. While working on this project, I ran into a few problems. I began by making extremely straightforward software that exported the list of items to a label for the person using it to see. Whenever the users launched the application or made modifications to the database, they needed to click a button to modify the items. It's not optimal, as I soon found out; an ongoing view of the database's contents would be far more ideal. In order to make it easier for users to choose and update elements in their program, I created a treeview functionality.  There were a number of challenges with constructing this treeview that functioned with SQL data, including proper updates and information transmission across the tree and database. I opted to have the database be updated regularly after performing changes. I also changed it so that when the user doubles-clicks a choice in the treeview, it automatically generates the textboxes, allowing the users to perform quick adjustments.
  
With this assignment, I met a number of programming aims, including "proving the capacity to use legitimate and creative methods, skills, and resources in computational practices for the objective of executing technological solutions that deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals." I was enabled to accomplish this by developing novel functionalities such as live-view database editing. I also experienced the following outcome: Establish an attitude of security that predicts hostile exploits in software design and structure to reveal possible weaknesses, mitigate weaknesses in design, and protect data and resources' security and confidentiality. Having a secure application is critical, particularly when dealing with information. A firm may have consumer data it does not want to be stolen. To increase the security of my present scheme, I've added validation of errors and mechanisms to prevent SQL injection.

In general, this served as a great educational opportunity for me, and it was exciting to see the improvements that were attainable with this assignment. I've discovered a lot regarding SQLite and how to create simple Python GUIs in the course of my research. In general, I still have some improvement to complete on the application's GUI and performance, which may include incorporating oriented toward objects techniques. Instead of using global variables as I did, I believe subclasses and OOP would prove much more effective as well as simpler to understand.
