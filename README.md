A C++ software that determines a student's median rating and letter grade is an initial artifact. This is one of the programs I made when I originally started learning C++ as a programming language. It was founded based on the C++ course on the Codecademy site that I took a couple of years ago.I chose this item since I thought it would make an excellent representation of my multilingualism and comprehension. One of the possibilities listed in the rubric was to think about translating an assignment into another programming language, which is exactly what I did with mine. The artifact has undergone improvements so that it may now be used in a broader Java project instead of only C++, though I do not believe that it has been made better technically.

I also think that it proves that I can use that skill in a large project, especially when working in my future job when asked to change software to another programming language, that kind of skill is important in the workforce. Regarding the improvement of the artifact, I believe transferring the script from C++ into Java and running it without errors would be a great example of understanding multiple programming languages as mentioned in the rubric of our course. I believe I have met the course objectives that I was planning to meet with the enhancement in module one. I have met some of the course outcomes for this enhancement as such; In the discipline of computer science, use techniques for creating cooperative settings that allow a variety of audiences to assist in company decision-making. Creating, architecting, and presenting written, verbal, and visual communications of an expert caliber that are technically sound, logical, and well-tailored to different audiences and situations. Show that you can apply reputable and cutting-edge methods, abilities, and resources in computing practices to build computer solutions that provide value and meet specific industry objectives.

I discovered that, at least superficially, the two languages are fairly comparable during the process of translating this C++ application into Java, and that knowing the fundamentals of both of them was quite helpful. The most difficult thing for me to do was to pick up where I left off with C++ and start coding in Java again. It took a little longer than it would have taken if I had been studying Java code because it had been a while since I performed any of it. It was a good experience as I have never attempted to transfer software from one programming language to another, even though the project is relatively small, it’s a good start to transferring a bigger project from one programming language to another. 

The big enhancement that I did for this artifact besides changing the script from C++ to Java. The advantages of the improvement I made are listed below. Putting in place a user-friendly GUI, also a lovely format for the output. Incorporating sophisticated query features like GPA ranges and surname wildcards. giving the individual the ability to add and remove courses. Rely just on JRE and no additional external environments or plugins. Occasionally, the UGMS uses checkboxes or messaging windows to trigger warnings.

  The code review: https://youtu.be/lKUpwpxLtIk

            The Zoo Monitor System Program is the artifact that was chosen for the algorithms and data structure category. The objective of this program is to create a system for verification that controls permissions and verification for admins and zookeeper clients. As a component of the computer science seminar IT-145, the software application was conceptualized, created, and developed. The software is created in the programming language known as Java and runs on a machine with a terminal as an independent program. This artifact was chosen because it required comprehension of an application algorithm made up of two primary systems, an authentication & authorization system, and components for a system of surveillance that were enhanced. The users ought to only see information relevant to their role after they log into the application in question. The artifact is made up of architectural elements for user credential-based authentication and authorization into the monitor system as well as responsibility for the user's interactions with various module screens and actions depending on their position inside the monitor network.
 
The artifact entails the development of procedures for input data validation as well as default denial-aware architecture and design. This ability instills in us an attitude of security that foresees hostile vulnerabilities in software structures and designs to reveal potential weaknesses, reduce deficiencies in design, and guarantee privacy as well as enhanced information safety and resource protection. Several classes and methods are divided within the source code according to their functions and actions. We use arguments and variables in scope to demonstrate the technical implications of the connection and functioning between the various classes and methods. scanning external files into a string array variable-based flexible data structure to assess the circumstances surrounding user inputs, scanning data files line-by-line to assess conditions, and scanning information files to show their contents on the screen. The basic linear structure of data used by all of the application's classes' methods is the string array. By controlling the compromises involved in design decisions, this method enhances the development and assessment of computing solutions that use computational concepts, computer science techniques, and standards relevant to its resolution to tackle a specific issue. 

Through importing from outside animal or habitat files, individuals can now list possible creatures or habitats, keep track of the daily activities of the animals under supervision, and monitor the living conditions of the animals. We demonstrate our prowess in software development, user needs analysis and interpretation, and programmatic implementation of tasks inside a structured framework. The capacity to convert a software situation into pseudocode as a single piece of program code comes from knowing the algorithms needed for it. We are able to identify the structured arrangement of a sequence of codes that may be divided into four classes and one main class. A menu display class that is repeated in each of the three main system modules makes up a single of the four classes. In order to present a header and banner, empty the shell screen, and utilize two independent classes—one for Basic colors and another for wrap lines—we incorporate GUI operations into the application's foundation. These acts illustrate our capacity to apply sound and creative technology approaches, skills, and resources to develop sustainable technology solutions that add value and achieve particular industry objectives. They also accord with the fundamentals of customer-centered design.

The source code is consistently formatted correctly, has a clear organization, and includes line breaks. According to best practices and their application in computer programming, we make use of the correct syntax and norms. The programmable data structures that are created allow for the effective use of the recorded value of variables in other class methods. Since they describe operations being carried out on a certain thing, names for methods are verbs. Dividing into methods and classes, as well as how to categorize each one and its placement when integrated into the program, results in substantial problems. We modified the software to handle problems as a result of this classification approach by figuring out if it operates through the operating system's terminal shell or via the NetBeans outputting line. In order to get our application coding to the desired point, we experimented with several code blocks to demonstrate a straightforward GUI with an attractive display. I think that’s one of the difficulties that I have to deal with while working on the enhancements for this artifact.
